        <p>Hello, my name is Johnny Catullo and I'm currently a junior at <br> East Stroudsburg 
            University for Computer Science and Computer Security!<br><br> I've always had a passion<br> 
            for computing technology ever since I was little as I got my first computer at the<br>  age of four. What intrigues 
            me the most about computers is that they are always <br> changing and everyday there is  something new to learn.
            I've built my own personal computer <br> that runs Windows and Unix and started
            self learning languages such as: Python and Javascript.<br>
            Projects I've created either in class or on my own time will be located in<br>
            the projects tab. I'll be adding more and more projects with documentation <br>
            in the future.
        </p>
    
    
        <p>I've created this website in order to teach myself HTML,CSS and Javascript.<br>
        I'll be adding more content to this website in the future. If you encounter any <br>
        bugs, problems or display issues, please email me! My email and contact information <br>
        will be located under the contacts tab.<br>
        All the photographs on this website have been taken by me.</p>
